## Introduction
  This is an exhaustive report for Kaggle-M5-Accuracy ended in July 1th. Background information is presented [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy). The Competition Guide is available [here](https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/M5-Competitors-Guide-Final-10-March-2020.docx). Below is a picture and a chart for the structure of the dataset:![alt text][Data Structure]
